# Elvora agency completion audit — 17 October 2026

Scope: the supplied complete-agency and UI/UX audit prompts. Preserve the existing Elvora identity, four fictional website concepts, six UI studies, genuine supplied Coursiv certificate, actual contact email and social profiles. The owner approved moving beyond Next.js 14 to resolve its reported framework advisories.

| Area | Existing baseline | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Framework | Next.js 14.2.35 with a critical production finding | Next.js 15.5.28, React 18 retained; async request APIs migrated; current production audit has zero findings |
| Public content | Established homepage, demos, studies, policies, tools, workflow and journey | Preserved and refined; service details, project notes, FAQs, canonical metadata and factual Person structured data added |
| CMS | Projects, bots, skills, certificates, settings | Added services, FAQs and permission-approved testimonials, ordering, publishing and audit events |
| Inquiries | SMTP required before optional storage | Durable database acceptance independent from email; company/service fields; accurate notification state |
| Lead management | Read/delete, latest 100 only | Search, status filter, chronological sort, bounded pagination, status and private notes |
| Authentication | Credentials, bcrypt, optional encrypted TOTP, version checks in APIs | Server page checks, bcrypt byte-bound login, expired lockout recovery, database session revocation on sign-out |
| Initial admin | Coupled to demonstration seed | Separate first-admin bootstrap; serializable refusal when any admin exists; no public registration |
| Authenticity | Labeled review/portrait previews | Unapproved reviews hidden; genuine review publication requires permission; original Elvora About composition |
| Motion | Many per-word Framer components | Shared viewport observer and CSS word/card reveals; interactive motion retained; hero immediately readable |
| Consent | Banner inserted after hydration | Initial server HTML banner; valid saved choice hidden before hydration; same parser/expiry rules; optional features default off |
| Loading | Root streaming fallback | Loading boundary scoped to private admin; public text visible without JavaScript |
| Deployment | Next 14 launch blocker and historical setup | Current migration/bootstrap/contact/security/testing guidance; real provider configuration remains necessary |

Important implementation paths:

- `app/services/[slug]/page.tsx`, `app/work/[slug]/page.tsx`, `components/faq-section.tsx`, `app/agency.css`.
- `data/agency.ts`, `lib/content-loader.ts`, `lib/admin/schemas.ts`.
- `app/api/admin/[resource]/route.ts`, `components/admin-app.tsx`, `data/admin.ts`.
- `app/api/contact/route.ts`, `lib/records.ts`, `components/contact-form.tsx`.
- `lib/admin/auth.ts`, `scripts/bootstrap-admin.ts`, `prisma/schema.prisma`, additive migration `202610170001_agency_content_and_leads`.
- `components/reveal-observer.tsx`, `components/text-reveal.tsx`, `components/reveal.tsx`, `lib/consent.ts`.
- `tests/agency.integration.mjs`, `tests/auth.integration.mjs`, `tests/helpers/https-proxy.mjs`.

The CMS uses PostgreSQL through Prisma. File mode is explicit and remains the default; database content mode fails rather than silently substituting file records. `CONTACT_STORAGE=database` can store inquiries while public content stays in file mode. No role hierarchy is added: this is a single-operator private admin, with all privileged operations authorized on the server.

No client identities, customer quotes, approved portraits, metrics, business results or provider credentials were invented. The reference animation timings and live deployment are not claimed as verified. See `VERIFICATION.md` for executed checks and measured limitations, and `DEPLOYMENT.md` for the remaining owner configuration.

Owner-login follow-up: fixed the configuration-error redirect loop, made failures visible and session-verified, prefilled the requested business email, and added private opt-in production-build owner activation. The admin login no longer depends on public CMS metadata. See `OWNER_LOGIN.md`; live Vercel activation still requires its actual private settings and access.

## BOTPRESS_SETUP.md

``````md
# Forte O Level Study Assistant

The first real-bot card is connected to the two public scripts supplied by the owner:

- Loader: `https://cdn.botpress.cloud/webchat/v5.0/inject.js`
- Configuration: `https://files.bpcontent.cloud/2026/10/09/06/20261009063223-SY2FHGEQ.js`

Both addresses live in `realBotConfig` in `data/bots.ts`. No Botpress admin token or OpenAI key is needed to embed this published widget. Botpress still controls its publishing state, usage allowance, conversation storage and replies.

After your host deploys GitHub `main`, open **AI Bots → Forte O Level Study Assistant** and click anywhere on the card or its **Open chat** label. The static chat preview shows the owner-supplied greeting; the real Botpress widget loads only after the click. The card is a single keyboard-accessible button (Enter/Space). The loader runs first, the configuration runs next, and the adapter opens the chat on Botpress's `webchat:ready` event. A loading message, timeout and retry button cover connection failures. Closing the panel removes the frame and its scripts; reopening starts a fresh embedded page. Provider-side session retention is managed by Botpress.

The trusted Botpress adapter runs in a dedicated same-origin frame with scripts, forms, storage and popups permitted. It is not an origin security boundary from the portfolio. Only official Botpress loader and configuration hosts/paths are accepted by this adapter; a nonce authorizes its fixed bootstrap code. Generic script widgets retain their opaque sandbox. Third-party code should only come from providers the owner trusts.

`CONTENT_SOURCE=files` uses this connection immediately. In database mode, edit the existing `real` bot at `/admin/bots`, change its name to **Forte O Level Study Assistant**, choose `script` and paste the equivalent public config from `data/bots.ts` into its config field. Add `cdn.botpress.cloud,files.bpcontent.cloud` to `BOT_PROVIDER_ALLOWLIST` before saving. Seeding preserves existing database records and will not replace the previous connection.

If the live widget does not appear, confirm the latest hosting deploy succeeded, publish the bot in Botpress, and check the provider's allowed website/domain settings if enabled. Permit the actual portfolio domain, including `portfolio3821.netlify.app` if that is the current site. Do not add API keys to these public script URLs.

Local validation uses explicit Botpress SDK fixtures to check script order, initialization/opening, storage, close cleanup, mobile layout, errors and retry. The cloud network returned HTTP 403 for the real Botpress assets, so actual provider loading and AI replies still need verification in the owner's browser after deployment.

## Privacy choice before embedding

The public card still opens its in-page panel with one click. `BotEmbed` now waits for the visitor to allow third-party chat through the cookie banner, preferences, or the explicit in-panel permission button. Before permission no provider frame is created. Withdrawing permission removes an open frame and prevents future loading. Visitors who already accepted external chat reach the connected chat directly. Provider-side data already sent is not erased by this control. See `PRIVACY_SETUP.md`.
``````

## CHATBOT_SETUP.md

``````md
# Part 2 — AI chatbot services

The complete portfolio includes AI Chatbot Services alongside About Me, Skills, Certification and Contact. The AI Bots navbar anchor opens the AI tab, including direct links to `#ai-bots`. The first real-bot card now connects the owner's **Forte O Level Study Assistant** Botpress widget; see `BOTPRESS_SETUP.md`.

## Install and run

```bash
npm ci --cache /tmp/portfoli-npm-cache
test -e .env.local || cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Only copy the example if `.env.local` does not already exist. Edit that ignored file securely: set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and leave `OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini` for the supplied Chat Completions implementation. Never put secrets in messages, public variables, bot data or browser code. No valid key is included. Restart Next.js after changing server variables.

Allow outbound HTTPS to `api.openai.com` where networking is restricted. Add the actual real-bot and Redis provider domains once selected, preserving existing network permissions. Saving an environment draft does not apply runtime network changes.

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:chat
npm run build
npm start
```

Stop the development server before building the same `.next` directory. No separate application server is needed.

## One real-bot config

The supplied Botpress connection is in `realBotConfig` in `data/bots.ts`; its card content is in the same data file. To use a different bot, replace that object with ONE of these shapes. An empty destination displays “Connection pending”.

### Hosted iframe

```ts
export const realBotConfig: RealBotConfig = {
  method: "iframe",
  url: "https://your-provider.com/embed/your-bot",
};
```

Supply a public hosted embed URL without secret query parameters. The provider must permit framing. Its chat manages history, typing state and privacy. This iframe permits scripts, forms, provider storage and popups; use only a trusted cross-origin provider page. The portfolio cannot inspect an external conversation.

### Script widget

```ts
export const realBotConfig: RealBotConfig = {
  method: "script",
  src: "https://your-provider.com/widget.js",
  mountId: "bot-root",
  attributes: { "data-bot-id": "your-public-bot-id" },
};
```

Transfer the external script URL and public `data-*` attributes from your provider's snippet. Do not paste raw HTML, event attributes, inline JavaScript or secrets. Optional `integrity` accepts the provider's authentic SRI hash; never invent one. Generic scripts run inside an opaque sandboxed frame with a CSP allowing that script origin. The specific Botpress adapter adds a `botpress: { configurationSrc: "https://files.bpcontent.cloud/...js" }` field, sequential loading and storage support in a same-origin frame. This trusted-provider exception is not an origin security boundary; see `BOTPRESS_SETUP.md`. Other widgets requiring extra permissions need their own reviewed adapter or the hosted iframe/API method.

### API endpoint

```ts
export const realBotConfig: RealBotConfig = {
  method: "api",
  endpoint: "https://your-provider.com/chat",
  requestField: "messages",
  responsePath: "reply",
  authHeader: "Authorization",
  authPrefix: "Bearer ",
};
```

Put optional authentication only in `REAL_BOT_API_KEY` in `.env.local`. For an `x-api-key` provider, set that `authHeader` and use `authPrefix: ""`. The owner-configured endpoint must be trusted public HTTPS; visitors cannot supply an endpoint. Redirects are rejected. Do not configure an internal service or untrusted hostname.

`requestField: "messages"` sends `{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}` with bounded history. `requestField: "message"` sends only `{"message":"Hello"}`; that provider must manage its own context. The default response is `{"reply":"Hello"}`. Dot paths such as `answer`, `data.reply` or `choices.0.message.content` are supported. Providers needing custom session IDs, streaming, tools or other payloads require an adapter in `lib/chat/provider.ts`. The external bot controls its own prompts and generation limits.

## Demo behavior

| Bot | Embed method | Prompt | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cedar Support | Custom UI via API | `data/prompts/support.ts` | Fictional Cedar & Co. shipping, returns and product-care facts. No actual order access. |
| Meetly Booking | Custom UI via API | `data/prompts/booking.ts` | Collects a sample service, date and time; asks for confirmation; clearly marks the result as simulated. No real reservation. |
| Aura Voice | Custom UI via API + Web Speech | `data/prompts/voice.ts` | Editable speech transcript, manual sending and optional browser speech playback. |

The booking prompt receives the current server date in Asia/Karachi. Sample times use that timezone. There is no calendar, database write, account access or confirmation email. Do not request visitors' contact or sensitive details in these demos.

Successful conversations stay in React memory per bot across panel closes, with up to 40 displayed messages per bot. Reload/clear removes this local history. Only the newest complete pairs fitting the context limit go upstream. Failed or cancelled messages do not enter accepted context. Provider retention is separate from browser memory; avoid confidential input.

## Limits and spending

- 1,000 characters per user message, 11 alternating user/assistant messages, 6,000 total context characters and a 32 KiB request body.
- Demo replies: maximum 256 output tokens, 4,000 displayed characters, a 20-second provider timeout and 64 KiB upstream JSON limit. The model and token limit cannot be set by visitors.
- Six requests/minute and 30/day per visitor bucket; `CHAT_DAILY_REQUEST_CAP` defaults to 100/day globally across API bots. Days reset at UTC midnight. Reservations count even if an upstream call fails. Two provider calls can run concurrently per process.
- Leave `CHAT_TRUSTED_IP_HEADER` blank unless your trusted edge proxy overwrites it and prevents client spoofing. Blank deliberately uses one shared visitor bucket. Do not trust arbitrary incoming forwarding headers.
- Development supports in-memory counters. Production fails closed without a Redis REST store unless `CHAT_ALLOW_IN_MEMORY_LIMITER=true` is explicitly selected for a single-process deployment. Memory limits reset on restart and do not protect multiple instances.
- For serverless/multiple instances, set both `CHAT_REDIS_REST_URL` and `CHAT_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` for an Upstash-compatible REST service. An atomic Lua script reserves shared quotas. Store failures fail closed.
- Request quotas are NOT a dollar spending cap. Use a dedicated provider project/key, budget alerts and an enforceable billing limit where supported; verify whether a provider's budget is only a soft alert. Other uses of the key are outside these quotas. `CHAT_ENABLED=false` pauses all API bots. External real bots need their own generation/cost limits.

## Prompt-injection guard

The server selects server-only system prompts. Client system/developer roles, arbitrary models, endpoints and token limits are never accepted. Common Unicode-normalized instruction-override patterns are rejected, and the system boundary treats the entire conversation as untrusted data. AI output is plain text, never executable HTML. Models have no tools, secrets, private records or external actions. This is defense in depth, not a guarantee against every prompt injection; do not add confidential material to demo prompts. External providers control their own bot protections.

## Voice checks

Use HTTPS in production; loopback development is a secure context. Voice input supports `SpeechRecognition`/`webkitSpeechRecognition`; playback uses `speechSynthesis`. Only a user click starts the mic. Review transcripts before sending; they never auto-send. Unsupported browsers and permission denial keep text chat available. Your browser may send audio to its speech service. Closing the panel stops recognition, cancels speech and aborts pending chat requests. Actual recognition and voice quality require a manual test on your target device; automated tests simulate browser events.

## Replacement checklist

1. Securely set your OpenAI key in `.env.local` and restart Next.js.
2. Allow `api.openai.com` in restricted cloud network settings.
3. Supply your real public bot connection and choose one config shape; add an optional real API secret only to `.env.local`.
4. Configure shared Redis quotas for serverless/multiple instances, or explicitly choose the documented single-process option.
5. Set provider billing controls and review the fictional sample company policies/prompts before adapting them for real business.
6. Check actual provider embed permissions and Web Speech on your production HTTPS domain.
7. Retain Part 1's image, portrait, public email and production URL checklist. No new image assets are required.

## Database-managed bots and optional logging

`CONTENT_SOURCE=files` reads the four bots and the one `realBotConfig` object from `data/bots.ts`. Database mode reads published cards, public connections and optional custom system prompts from Prisma; edit them at `/admin/bots`. Add exact external provider hostnames to `BOT_PROVIDER_ALLOWLIST` before saving connections. New API bots can use their own server-only system prompt with the shared OpenAI adapter, or an external API configuration. Never store private keys in public configuration. Chat logs are off by default; if enabled in site settings, database retention and the public chat notice apply.

## CONCEPTS.md

``````md
# Four new custom concept websites

The selected portfolio now contains exactly four original concepts. The previous Elvora external/promotional card is removed from the selected grid.

| Website | Route | Visual direction | Working sample interaction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Solenne | `/demo/solenne` | Warm coastal photography, ivory/olive, editorial serif | Suites/villas filter, room selection, arrival/departure validation and local stay summary |
| Vanta Motors | `/demo/vanta` | Cinematic graphite/lime automotive campaign | Three model specifications, finish radio controls and local configuration summary |
| Aster Care | `/demo/aster` | Sage/ivory, rounded forms, calm care navigation | Care-category filtering and sample visit planner without personal/health data |
| Kovo Studio | `/demo/kovo` | Mineral/terracotta, architectural editorial grid | Residential/workplace filtering, illustrated design studies and local brief builder |

All are fictional **Concept Projects**. Original generated images and SVG illustrations support working Next.js pages; the gallery images are real browser captures of those pages. No client commissions, real buildings, clinical outcomes, reservations, vehicle sales or submitted enquiries are claimed. Sample forms do not call an external service or persist data.

`data/concepts.ts` contains page copy, themes, example items, labels and disclosures. `data/concept-images.ts` contains the complete prompts for the four generated hero assets in `public/concepts/`. `data/projects.ts` builds the selected cards and 16 gallery paths from the concept data. `components/concept-site.tsx` implements the different page layouts and interactions, styled by scoped `app/demo/concepts.css`. These pages run in the same Next.js app.

`npm run capture` renders the four selected pages at 1440×900 and 390×844, both 2×, into `public/projects/{slug}-1..4.webp`. See `SCREENSHOTS.md` for the exact filenames. Gallery navigation, the 3D laptop/phone compositions and full-page demo links use the existing portfolio components.

The Forte O Level Study Assistant is now a featured wide card with a static chat preview matching the supplied greeting. The entire card is a single accessible **Open chat** button. Clicking its preview, text or action opens the existing Botpress panel immediately; the adapter opens the provider widget when ready. The other three API demo cards remain available.

The default file content mode uses the new selection immediately. If an owner has switched to database mode, unpublish earlier project records and add/seed the four new project IDs (`solenne`, `vanta`, `aster`, `kovo`). Seeding preserves existing records; it does not silently remove previous projects. Rename the existing `real` Botpress bot in admin if needed. No schema migration is required.
``````

## CONTACT_SETUP.md

``````md
# Contact and inquiry setup

Public recipient: **abdulhafeez@elvoraai.online**. The form accepts name, email, optional company/service and a project message. The server validates strict input, checks origin, discards filled honeypots, applies quotas and verifies configured Turnstile before accepting work.

## Durable inbox

Configure PostgreSQL, run `npm run db:migrate`, bootstrap the admin and set `CONTACT_STORAGE=database`. This is independent of `CONTENT_SOURCE`; file-based public content can keep a real private inbox. Database content mode also enables inquiry storage.

The server saves first. Its 202 response reports `acceptance: "stored"`; optional notification is `accepted`, `failed` or `not-configured`. Missing SMTP or failed notification does not discard an already stored inquiry. The UI says the inquiry was saved without claiming delivery. A database save failure returns 503 and does not send mail or show success.

## Optional Gmail notification

Set private `GMAIL_SMTP_USER` to the Gmail sender and `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` to that account's Gmail App Password with 2-Step Verification. The sender defaults to the existing buildwithelvora@gmail.com account; the recipient remains the domain email above. Never use the ordinary Google password, expose credentials to the browser or paste them into source.

The implementation uses verified TLS on smtp.gmail.com:465, bounded timeouts, a fixed recipient, a validated reply-to and plaintext content. SMTP acceptance does not prove inbox delivery; check the actual recipient mailbox, spam folder and sender restrictions after deployment.

Without database storage, SMTP is required and failure returns an honest 502/503. No credentials produces no success response. Keep form details on failure so visitors can retry or email directly.

## Protection and privacy

Configure shared Redis REST limits for serverless/multiple instances and Turnstile keys for the actual hostname. Production protection fails closed when required settings are unavailable. Trust proxy IP headers only if the edge overwrites them. In-memory fallback is a deliberate single-process option, not a shared limit.

Private inbox access requires admin authorization. Review retention and provider agreements, and delete records when no longer needed. Optional chat consent does not control an inquiry the visitor deliberately submits. See `PRIVACY_SETUP.md` and the actual privacy policy.

Contact tests use explicit SMTP/Redis/Turnstile/storage fixtures; real-database integration also verifies durable acceptance without SMTP. Real email delivery must be checked with the configured provider on the public host. No real message was sent during automated verification.
``````

## DEPLOYMENT.md

``````md
# Elvora deployment and operations

The app uses Next.js 15.5.28 App Router, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion, PostgreSQL/Prisma and Auth.js Credentials. Node 22/24 is supported; validation used Node 24. Deploy with a Next.js server/runtime, not a static file upload.

## Install and check

```bash
npm ci --cache /tmp/portfoli-npm-cache --no-audit --no-fund
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:chat
npm run test:contact
npm run test:security
npm run test:consent
npm run build
npm start
```

Stop your own development server before building: development and production share `.next`. Keep the lockfile and security overrides. `postinstall` generates the Prisma JavaScript/WASM driver client; native Prisma engines are not needed at application runtime. The migration CLI downloads its verified engine when needed; allow `binaries.prisma.sh` without disabling integrity or TLS checks.

## Private configuration

Use `.env.example` as the variable-name template. Local values belong in ignored `.env.local`; hosted values belong in private hosting settings. Never put secrets in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, source files, chat or screenshots.

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and `NEXTAUTH_URL` to the actual HTTPS canonical origin, normally `https://www.elvoraai.online`. The canonical fallback is that real domain. Preview deployments receive noindex controls. DNS was already connected in the owner's setup; this change does not require replacing nameservers.

| Requirement | Variables |
| --- | --- |
| Database/admin | `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` |
| Initial admin, temporary | `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` |
| Shared rate protection | `AUTH_REDIS_REST_URL/TOKEN`, `CONTACT_REDIS_REST_URL/TOKEN`, `CHAT_REDIS_REST_URL/TOKEN`; blank separate stores reuse CHAT settings |
| Authenticator 2FA | Stable private `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, 32 random bytes encoded as base64 |
| Optional contact notifications | `GMAIL_SMTP_USER`, `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` |
| Contact anti-abuse | `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`, `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`, `CONTACT_TURNSTILE_REQUIRED=true` |
| AI API demos | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, optional model and quota settings |
| Admin image uploads | `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`, exact `BLOB_PUBLIC_HOST` |
| External bot configuration | Exact approved `BOT_PROVIDER_ALLOWLIST` hosts and published provider configuration |

Check the complete comments in `.env.example`. Shared quotas fail closed when unavailable. Set an in-memory limiter override only for an intentional single-process host; it resets on restart and does not protect multiple serverless instances. Trust an IP header only when the edge proxy overwrites it.

## Database and first administrator

For the one-time Vercel build activation, see [OWNER_LOGIN.md](OWNER_LOGIN.md). `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_ON_BUILD=true` runs the private migration/first-owner operation before `next build`; the default is off. Existing accounts are preserved and preview deployments skip it. Remove the temporary admin password and disable the flag after activation.


Provision PostgreSQL with TLS. Use a pooled application URL and a direct migration URL if your provider separates them. Back up existing data and review migration SQL before deployment.

```bash
npm run db:migrate
npm run admin:bootstrap
```

Bootstrap reads privately supplied `ADMIN_EMAIL` and a strong `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: at least 14 characters, upper/lowercase, a number and a symbol, at most 72 UTF-8 bytes. It stores only a bcrypt hash, prints no credentials, creates initial genuine site identity and refuses when any administrator exists. It does not create demonstration projects or reviews. Remove `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from the normal web runtime after bootstrap.

The additive agency migration adds services/FAQs/reviews and inquiry workflow fields. It preserves existing contact rows, backfills timestamps and adds status/permission constraints. Existing settings/email records are not overwritten by a changed schema default; update them through `/admin/settings` if needed.

Sign in at `/admin/login`. Admin pages and APIs check server authorization against the database session version. Enable authenticator 2FA from Security after configuring and backing up the encryption key. Password/2FA changes and sign-out invalidate previous sessions. Sign-out revokes all sessions for this single operator.

For private recovery, supply `ADMIN_EMAIL` and a new strong `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, then run `npm run admin:reset`. Set `RESET_ADMIN_2FA=true` only when deliberately recovering a lost authenticator. The command records the recovery and revokes old sessions. Do not run reset automatically during web builds.

## Choose public content and inquiry storage separately

- `CONTENT_SOURCE=files` is the default. The actual owner content and labeled fictional portfolio concepts come from `data/`. CMS edits do not replace this source automatically.
- `CONTENT_SOURCE=database` reads published database records, including services, projects, FAQs and approved reviews. Populate and review content through `/admin` before switching. Missing settings or a database outage produces an error; there is no silent file fallback.
- `CONTACT_STORAGE=database` stores inquiries independently from public content mode. Recommended when keeping file-based portfolio content with the private lead inbox.
- Email-only file mode without database storage needs working SMTP configuration. It does not invent inbox persistence.

For an isolated development database only:

```bash
SEED_CONTENT=demo npm run db:seed
```

Demo seed refuses `NODE_ENV=production`. It imports owner content and clearly labeled concepts without overwriting existing records; it creates no administrator or testimonial. Do not use demo seed to initialize real production data. Use the CMS to publish reviewed records.

## Manage content and leads

The private dashboard shows database counts and recent inquiries. Projects, bots, skills, certificates, services, FAQs and reviews support editing, ordering, publishing and deletion. Reviews require permission confirmation before publishing; add only genuine approved quotes and portraits. No reviews are displayed by default.

The inbox supports search, status filters, chronological ordering and pagination. Statuses are `new`, `contacted`, `in-progress`, `closed`; read/unread is separate. Internal notes are private. Notification status describes SMTP acceptance/failure/unconfigured state, not an assurance of inbox delivery. Audit entries record administrative mutations. Chat logging remains opt-in; establish retention before enabling it.

Image uploads require configured Blob storage. The server authorizes, limits, decodes and re-encodes JPEG/PNG/WebP, strips metadata and restricts displayed remote hosts. Local source assets work without Blob. Do not configure arbitrary remote image hosts.

## Contact and AI integrations

The public recipient is **abdulhafeez@elvoraai.online**. The Gmail SMTP sender/account is separately configured and must match its Gmail App Password. Do not replace the recipient with the SMTP login address. See `CONTACT_SETUP.md` for precise acceptance/failure behavior.

AI demos need an actual server-side API key and provider billing limits. App request quotas are not a currency spending cap. Keep shared quotas and output limits; verify real provider replies after deployment. The supplied Forte/Botpress scripts are preserved. Confirm its publishing state and allowed domains on the real provider account. Optional external chat must remain blocked until consent, and withdrawing permission removes embeds.

## Hosting, HTTPS and launch

For Vercel, import the repository, use the Next.js preset and set private variables. Review and run migrations in a trusted deployment job before releasing schema-dependent code. Use the same application schema for previews only when intentionally isolated; do not point routine tests at production. Netlify uses the included Next.js adapter configuration; configure the actual domain rather than historical preview URLs.

After deployment, verify the canonical redirect, valid certificates, all service/work routes, sitemap/robots, admin sign-in/logout/2FA, new inquiry visibility, real notifications and failure states. Check metadata, keyboard navigation and mobile layouts. Local build and browser tests do not prove the external deployment completed.

Configure automated encrypted PostgreSQL backups and retention with the provider, test restoration to a separate database, and back up stable auth/TOTP secrets through a secure process. Back up owned uploaded assets. Define inquiry/chat/audit deletion periods and access responsibilities. Code rollback across schema changes must preserve compatible columns; never drop real production data just to revert the UI.

Current dependency audit and remaining development-tool findings are in `SECURITY_STATUS.md`. Measured checks and screenshots are in `VERIFICATION.md`. No production service credentials or legal-compliance certification are included.

## OWNER_LOGIN.md

# Activate the Elvora owner login on Vercel

Owner sign-in: **https://www.elvoraai.online/admin/login**

Login email: **abdulhafeez@elvoraai.online**. This is an identifier for the website owner account. The mailbox password is not automatically connected to website authentication. Choose a separate strong administrator password privately.

The admin dashboard and database-backed authentication are implemented. The deployed project must have its own private configuration and first owner account. Adding details to the login form does not create an account.

## One-time private deployment setup

Open the **elvora-studio** Vercel project → **Settings → Environment Variables**. Use the **Production** environment. Never put secrets in NEXT_PUBLIC variables, source code, screenshots or chat.

| Variable                   | Set privately in Vercel                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`             | Application connection URL from your PostgreSQL provider                                                       |
| `DIRECT_URL`               | Direct migration connection URL from the same provider                                                         |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`          | Securely generated random secret, at least 32 characters; keep it stable                                       |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`             | `https://www.elvoraai.online`                                                                                  |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`     | `https://www.elvoraai.online`                                                                                  |
| `AUTH_REDIS_REST_URL`      | Shared Redis REST endpoint for login rate protection                                                           |
| `AUTH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`    | Matching private Redis REST token                                                                              |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL`              | `abdulhafeez@elvoraai.online`                                                                                  |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD`           | Your new strong admin password: 14+ characters with upper/lowercase, number and symbol; maximum 72 UTF-8 bytes |
| `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_ON_BUILD` | `true` for the first production deployment                                                                     |

Vercel's connected Upstash integration variables `KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` are now read directly for owner login protection; no duplicate mapping is needed. Native `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` also work. Explicit `AUTH_REDIS_REST_*` settings take precedence, followed by `CHAT_REDIS_REST_*`, KV and native Upstash. A partial higher-priority pair stops setup rather than borrowing another provider's token. Read-only tokens cannot replace the write token. Use verified provider URLs and TLS. Do not replace missing values with examples. A serverless Vercel deployment requires shared login protection; do not use an in-memory override to bypass this requirement.

Redeploy the current GitHub main branch using the repository's normal `npm run build` command. With the private flag enabled, the build applies the reviewed additive migrations and creates **only the first owner**. It does not seed demonstration data, expose a web registration/setup endpoint or change existing accounts/passwords. Preview deployments skip owner creation. Setup failures stop the flagged deployment with a safe message in its private build logs; no credentials or database URLs are printed.

After a successful first deployment, remove `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, set `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_ON_BUILD=false`, and redeploy. Sign in with the business email and the password you chose. Keep `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and the database/Redis configuration in the runtime.

If an account already exists, the setup operation preserves it. It will not turn a newly entered environment password into a password reset. Existing-account recovery is the deliberate private `npm run admin:reset` procedure in `DEPLOYMENT.md`; no public reset endpoint exists.

## Login feedback

### Build stops after migrations with a credential requirement

The supplied production log reached `Reviewed database migrations applied.` and then rejected the first-owner email/password. This is not an npm-install failure. Verify `ADMIN_EMAIL` privately and replace the manually added `ADMIN_PASSWORD` Secret in Vercel Production with a password satisfying all rules above. Do not use the Neon database password. Redeploy the latest main commit after saving; the updated script reports only the specific missing requirements, never the password. An existing owner is always preserved.

The `.env.local not found` notice is expected on Vercel when settings are supplied through environment variables. PostgreSQL's SSL-mode compatibility warning is not the credential error; do not disable TLS verification to suppress it.

- Incomplete private configuration shows **Owner sign-in needs setup** and a Check again button. Email/password remain editable with a show/hide password control, while submission stays unavailable until private setup is ready. The notice does not indicate a wrong password.
- The password is the website administrator password chosen during first-owner setup, not a Neon/PostgreSQL or email mailbox password. There is no default password.
- The authenticator field is collapsed by default and optional for accounts without 2FA. Open it only if you enabled two-factor authentication in the dashboard Security settings, then use the six-digit code from your authenticator app. Neither the database integration nor this UI change enables 2FA automatically. Accounts with 2FA continue to require a valid code on the server.
- Wrong credentials show a clear inline error and preserve entered details.
- Infrastructure failures and request throttling have separate safe messages.
- A successful callback must also establish an authorized session before navigating to the dashboard. Missing/blocked session cookies leave a visible explanation on the login page.
- Old `?error=...` redirects display a safe message instead of an apparently unchanged screen.

The initial email is prefilled, but there is no default password. No email verification or SMTP account is required for this Credentials sign-in. SMTP and AI configuration remain separate integrations.

## What has and has not been verified

Local production HTTPS checks verify the real owner creation, credentials, session, dashboard and failure paths against isolated PostgreSQL. They do not configure your Vercel account. Live environment values, production database state and deployment logs require access to the actual hosting project. Do not report live activation until those checks succeed on that project.

# Elvora personalization

Brand: **Elvora**. Owner: **Abdul Hafeez**. Public contact: **abdulhafeez@elvoraai.online** only. No phone or WhatsApp links. Owner-supplied GitHub and Instagram profiles are included.

The About Me section now summarizes the owner's supplied Python/AI exploration, agency work, independent development and startup aspirations. It explains structured prompts, review, testing, refinement and the frontend/backend/database/deployment fundamentals. The latest design avoids experience/project/success metric cards. AI tools are included as a toolkit without proficiency percentages. Genuine testimonials and approved client portraits are pending. The public review section is hidden until genuine permission-approved CMS records are published.

The supplied E-and-amber-dot logo is represented as a scalable SVG in `public/elvora-logo.svg` and the favicon in `app/icon.svg`. The navbar and footer pair it with the **Elvora** wordmark. The portrait caption also uses the brand instead of AH.

The supplied Coursiv certificate is now showcased: **Master of ChatGPT**, issued to **Abdul Hafeez** on **31 October 2024**, for a **6-hour** course. Certificate ID: **ADO6IJOS**. These details are transcribed from the uploaded PDF; no external credential verification is claimed. This is described as a course completion certificate, not an academic degree.

`public/certificates/coursiv-master-of-chatgpt.webp` is a high-resolution rendering of the uploaded certificate, preserving its original artwork and wording. The title, issuer, date, description and accessible image text live in `data/certificates.ts`. The fullscreen viewer supports zoom buttons, +/−, 0 to fit, Esc, touch/native scrolling and focus restoration. The old neutral placeholder remains available for new draft entries; `npm run certificate-placeholder` does not replace the real certificate.

Apply migrations and run the private first-admin bootstrap before using `/admin`. File mode remains the default. Demo seeding is development-only; use reviewed CMS records for database-mode production content.

The About Me area now contains an original Elvora brand composition rather than a substitute personal photo. The hero now displays the animated Elvora emblem. The owner has not uploaded a personal photo, so the abstract image is explicitly labeled **Portrait placeholder**. Once supplied, put the real image in `public/`, update `portrait` and `portraitAlt` in `data/site.ts`, and clear `portraitStatus`; the About Me portrait updates.

`app/premium.css` adds gold lighting, violet atmosphere, reflective buttons, hover depth, portrait motion, card glows and a scroll progress line. It preserves keyboard focus, light theme, mobile layouts and reduced-motion preferences. The current four concept websites and their actual screenshots are documented in `SCREENSHOTS.md`; the earlier Elvora promotional card has been removed from Selected Work.
``````

## PRIVACY_SETUP.md

``````md
# Privacy controls and studio content

The cookie banner presents **Accept All**, **Reject All**, and **Manage Preferences** with equal visual weight. Optional third-party chat defaults off. Essential storage is explained separately, and the only optional toggle corresponds to a real loaded feature. No analytics, advertising pixels or embedded social feeds have been added.

`ConsentProvider` wraps the app. It stores a versioned decision and timestamp under `elvora-consent-v1` in local storage for 180 days. Invalid, future-dated, expired or superseded choices require another decision. Storage failures retain an in-page choice and give an honest status message. Storage events synchronize other tabs, and returning to the tab checks saved/expired consent. The preferences dialog uses native dialog semantics, keyboard focus containment, Escape and focus restoration.

`BotEmbed` creates no provider iframe until third-party chat is permitted. The existing Forte card still opens its in-page panel with one click; if permission is missing, the panel gives a just-in-time explanation and explicit permission button. Accepting the banner ahead of time preserves the direct chat experience. Revocation unmounts the active iframe and stops future loading. It cannot delete provider-side data or third-party stored values, so the notice does not claim otherwise. The server-side AI API demos remain usable without external-embed permission; their submitted text still goes to the configured AI provider when used.

Theme storage remembers an explicit theme choice. Sign-in and configured anti-abuse features are necessary security functions, explained in the policy. Contact form security may use Cloudflare Turnstile; it is not an advertising feature. No payment, analytics or social tracking SDK is installed.

## Policies and owner responsibilities

`/privacy`, `/cookies`, and `/terms` have readable responsive pages, independent titles/canonical URLs, footer navigation, and Cookie Settings. The policy copy describes the current architecture rather than promising integrations that have not been verified. The owner must review it against actual hosting/email/AI/anti-abuse providers, retention/deletion practice, business identity, served regions, and contractual/legal obligations before treating it as legal advice or a compliance guarantee. Update the policy and increment `consentContent.version` before introducing a new optional purpose. No universal legal-compliance certification is claimed.

## Genuine reviews and personal data

The public Wall of Love is hidden by default. In database content mode, add genuine review copy, name/role and an approved local/Blob portrait through the private CMS. Publication requires `permissionConfirmed`; a database CHECK constraint also rejects unapproved publication. No stock face or invented endorsement is shown. The carousel pauses on hover/focus/hidden tabs, supports keyboard/manual controls and disables autoplay with reduced motion.

The owner supplied the journey copy, four services, GitHub and Instagram URLs and requested the AI-tool category. No client/project/success totals or new experience-duration claims are added. About Me uses original Elvora brand artwork instead of a substitute personal photo. The owner has now supplied the design-reference images, which inform the latest layouts; review copy and approved client portraits remain pending. The hero uses the existing Elvora logo as a CSS sculpture. Tool tiles use custom typographic marks and product names without endorsement claims.

The initial consent banner is server rendered. A nonce-protected script uses the same version/expiry parser to hide it for a valid saved choice before hydration; this script does not grant provider permission. Optional permission still starts off in the provider context until the saved record has been validated. Public content stays visible with JavaScript disabled; optional embeds do not load.

Agency services, FAQs and permission-approved reviews have an additive database migration. Copy lives in `data/agency.ts`, `data/studio.ts`, `data/experience.ts`, `data/skills.ts` and `data/privacy.ts`; actual policy and provider configuration must stay aligned. In database mode, update existing skills/settings through admin. Never seed destructive replacements over existing content.

# Elvora — Abdul Hafeez's portfolio

**Current status:** approved Next.js 15.5.28 migration, real inquiry/CMS workflow and agency detail pages are implemented. Production dependency audit: zero findings; remaining development-tool findings and private service requirements are documented in `SECURITY_STATUS.md` and `DEPLOYMENT.md`. Local validation does not prove live deployment.

Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion. All application backend logic runs in Next.js route handlers. Selected Work contains four bespoke fictional websites: Solenne (hotel), Vanta Motors (automotive), Aster Care (private clinic) and Kovo Studio (architecture), each with a working demo and four actual browser-captured gallery images. CSS 3D laptop/phone cards present their desktop and mobile views. The featured Forte O Level Study Assistant card displays a chat preview and opens its in-page Botpress panel with one click anywhere on the card. External chat permission is required before the provider embed loads. The portfolio retains three API chat demos, voice controls, About Me, the supplied Coursiv certificate, domain-email contact and the private PostgreSQL/Prisma/Auth.js admin. Older demos and the Elvora promotional asset are archived and are not selected work.

Current UI/video update: [purple palette, preserved custom designs, visibility-controlled showcases, Testimonials and complete changed-file list](docs/PURPLE_VIDEO_UPDATE.md).

Latest playback/navigation update: [wide looping videos, interactive desktop windows and measured page readiness](docs/READY_PLAYBACK_UPDATE.md).

## Categorized public pages

All three requested design sources—Emil, Apple HIG and Liquid Glass—are integrated. The latest addition uses actual WebGL refraction behind native navigation controls, with opaque menus and accessible fallbacks. See the [combined final review, exact changes and verification](docs/THREE_SKILLS_FINAL_REVIEW.md). The shader runtime is pinned locally; no CDN is required.

Apple HIG guidance is also installed as `$apple-hig-design`, alongside the existing Emil Apple skill. Its focused web review improves chat touch targets, keyboard focus and optional contrast/transparency preferences while preserving the custom design. See [integration, source and measured checks](docs/APPLE_HIG_INTEGRATION.md).

Emil Kowalski's supplied skills are now installed as project development guidance. A skill-based audit fixed saved Motion Off video downloads, touch controls, selected-theme browser color and offscreen footer work while preserving the custom design. See [audit, evidence and limits](docs/EMIL_SKILLS_AUDIT.md) and [skill provenance](.agents/skills/SOURCE.md).

Latest copy/SEO update: clear website-development and custom-data chatbot services for international clients, with distinct homepage/service search titles and plain-English homepage wording. The supplied PageSpeed report is reviewed separately; performance behavior is unchanged. See [copy, metadata, audit priorities and validation](docs/SEO_COPY_AND_PAGESPEED_REVIEW.md).

Latest media update: the owner's original PDF portrait is fitted into the About frame, and the rotating collection video uses real transparency with a matching purple MP4 fallback. See [implementation, validation and previews](docs/PORTRAIT_TRANSPARENT_COLLECTION.md).

Latest homepage presentation: full-width light and black sections, with a white/deep-purple split for AI Bots and Bunch of Work. Theme switching, original artwork and motion remain functional. See [current desktop/mobile previews and checks](docs/HOMEPAGE_BANDS.md).

The homepage Websites and AI Bots previews use the owner's supplied architectural and delivery-chat videos as silent loops on desktop and phones. The website video has rounded corners on all four sides. Motion Off shows matching posters; the subject pages keep their own showcases.

The website video now spans the page with dark edge blending; both homepage videos retain rounded bottom corners. Keep exploring uses bolder typography, purple highlights and visible-only accent animations on desktop and phones.

The Bunch of Work homepage collage is now the owner's rotating-design video, also looping with rounded corners and Motion Off support. The dedicated collection page retains its original interactive curved wall.

The homepage introduces Elvora with a monochrome presentation, original logo motion and large visual previews of websites, bots and the collection. Its light/dark switch remains functional. Ten subject pages organize the content. Websites, How I Build Websites and Technical Domains share `/websites`; the former `/ai-websites` and `/technical-domains` routes redirect there. How I Build Bots and all three embedding methods remain beneath the bot demos. About tabs contain About Me, My Journey, Skills & Tools and Certificates. The original designed footer, including the large wordmark, waves, emblem and socials, is preserved throughout.

Web development leads the site copy and tool categories; AI supports selected tasks. The About text explains the importance of experience, coding foundations, databases and human review. Testimonials has gently floating cards, local illustrated fictional profiles and background particles on desktop and mobile. Sample reviews are visibly marked as fictional examples; published, permission-approved CMS feedback replaces them. Global Motion Off and a local Pause control stop the effects. See [the current changes and verification](docs/WEBSITES_TESTIMONIALS.md).

Project previews are unboxed, without concept badges, counters, device-format labels or floating controls. Original website art/device models and the 54-tile curved collection are preserved. Visible device previews now float on mobile and use native-scroll 3D movement; desktop pointer tilt and Motion Off remain available.

See [the restored homepage and content grouping](docs/RESTORED_HOMEPAGE.md) and [the current page map](docs/CATEGORIZED_PAGES.md). Earlier single-page reports below describe previous revisions.

## Agency features

Services and project-note routes, native FAQs, a private service/FAQ/review CMS, searchable paginated inquiries with status and private notes, actual dashboard counts and audit history. Contact acceptance distinguishes database storage from optional SMTP notification. Genuine approved reviews appear only after publication; the About section shows the owner's original supplied portrait within the Elvora frame.

The public hero is readable immediately. Shared CSS/viewport reveals retain the motion style while reducing per-word client work. Cookie choices still control optional embeds, and public text remains visible without JavaScript.

- [Activate owner login on Vercel](OWNER_LOGIN.md)
- [Deployment and first-admin setup](DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [Testing and measured verification](VERIFICATION.md)

## Run

Use Node.js 22 or 24. Retain the lockfile.

```bash
npm ci --cache /tmp/portfoli-npm-cache
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Do not overwrite an existing `.env.local`. Set the actual site URL; the example origin is not a deployable value. The public portfolio works with `CONTENT_SOURCE=files` without database/API/mail credentials. The three API demos, mail, uploads and private administration need their own secure settings; unconfigured services report an honest unavailable state.

```bash
npm run test:chat
npm run test:contact
npm run test:security
npm run test:consent
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm start
```

`npm ci` generates the Prisma JS-driver client through the pinned Prisma WASM parser. No native Prisma engine is needed at application runtime. Prisma's migration CLI may still download its verified schema engine; allow `binaries.prisma.sh` when running migrations. Never disable checksum checks. Fonts are bundled locally through npm and `next/font/local`.

## Actual concept screenshots

The selected demos are `/demo/solenne`, `/demo/vanta`, `/demo/aster` and `/demo/kovo`. Each has a distinct layout, original generated hero imagery, vector details and working local interactions. Try stay filters/date validation, car model/finish configuration, care-service filtering/sample visit planning and architecture/project-type filtering. All businesses, properties and specifications are fictional. No real bookings, orders, payments, healthcare or enquiries are processed.

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
npm run capture
```

The capture script starts and stops its own development server on port 3100. Stop other Next.js servers first, since development and production share `.next`. Alternatively, set `CAPTURE_BASE_URL` to an already-running app and capture that server. Desktop views are 1440×900, mobile 390×844, both at 2× device scale. `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE` can select a system Chromium; `/usr/bin/chromium` is detected automatically when present. See `SCREENSHOTS.md` for all 16 filenames and four optional image-generation prompts. Existing captures are included, so a browser installation is not required to run the portfolio.

## Content and data boundaries

All editable portfolio content starts in `data/`. `lib/content-loader.ts` is the server-only boundary: `CONTENT_SOURCE=database` uses published Prisma records after migration and deliberate CMS content preparation. File mode remains explicit; database failures never substitute file records. `CONTACT_STORAGE=database` enables durable inquiries independently. Initial admin creation uses `npm run admin:bootstrap`; seed is guarded, additive and development/demo-only.

- `data/site.ts`: Elvora identity, Abdul Hafeez's introduction, domain email, navigation and shared UI text.
- `data/projects.ts`, `concepts.ts`, `concept-images.ts`: the four selected concepts, page content, 16 screenshot paths, generated-image prompts and design details. `data/demos.ts` retains archived demos.
- `data/bots.ts`: bot cards, disclosures, one `realBotConfig` object for iframe/script/API, and an optional `additionalBots` list for adding data-configured connections. The real slot connects the supplied Forte O Level Study Assistant Botpress scripts; see `BOTPRESS_SETUP.md`. `data/prompts/` contains the three server-only demo prompts.
- `data/experience.ts`, `skills.ts`: About Me summary, AI workflow explanations and an expanded AI/development toolkit; no invented client counts or testimonials.
- `data/certificates.ts`: supplied Master of ChatGPT certificate details and image, click-to-enlarge/zoom viewer.
- `data/contact.ts`, `admin.ts`: validated form content and admin labels/field definitions.
- `public/portrait-placeholder.svg`: replace with the owner's actual portrait and update its alt/placeholder wording in `data/site.ts`.

The only public contact is **abdulhafeez@elvoraai.online**. No WhatsApp or phone number is displayed. Owner-supplied GitHub and Instagram links are included. The supplied Coursiv Master of ChatGPT certificate is displayed with its 31 October 2024 issue date and 6-hour course duration. About Me summarizes the owner's supplied journey and thoughtful use of AI without metric cards. AI tool names are now included; the personal portrait and genuine testimonials are still pending. See `PART_3.md` for personalization.

## Backend setup

- `CHATBOT_SETUP.md`: real-bot methods, AI keys, shared limits, spending controls and voice limitations.
- `CONTACT_SETUP.md`: Gmail App Password, Turnstile, inbox persistence and delivery semantics.
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`: PostgreSQL, Auth.js, 2FA, uploads, migrations, seeding, Vercel/Netlify, domain/SSL and pre-launch checks.

No production password, API key, database connection or provider token is included. Keep secrets in ignored `.env.local` or hosting secret settings. Do not send passwords in chat.

## Review without downloading

![Elvora project showcase](docs/preview.png)

The complete file-by-file source snapshot, starting with the folder structure and Prisma schema, is available in [`delivery/README.md`](delivery/README.md). `VERIFICATION.md` records tested flows and remaining production requirements.

## Studio design and privacy update

Services, a separate My bunch of work contact sheet, eight-tool creative directory, five-step workflow, the owner-supplied journey, one-at-a-time review preview, animated hero emblem and large footer wordmark are configured in `data/studio.ts`. The latest feature update adds categorized skill rows, five technical-domain bento cards, oversized journey typography, an ivory Let’s talk panel, pill footer navigation and a violet wave sign-off. Local tool marks are shared by the skill rows and directory; no new runtime dependency or tracking is introduced. The owner has now supplied the numbered reference images. The latest service grid, horizontal workflow, journey, portrait-left About and editorial footer adapt those compositions to Elvora. The live Framer URL remains blocked here, so exact animation timing is not claimed. See `REFERENCE_DESIGN.md`.

`data/privacy.ts` contains policy copy and consent settings. See `PRIVACY_SETUP.md` for actual behavior and owner review. Four consent parsing tests run with `node --import tsx --test tests/consent.test.ts`. Review/portrait placeholders are explicit; publish only genuine approved material.

The separate My bunch of work collage includes four website concepts plus six new coded UI studies at `/studies/[slug]`. Their snapshots are actual browser captures with fictional data clearly identified. `data/studies.ts` configures the studies and `npx tsx scripts/capture-studies.ts` refreshes their WebP images.

Latest previews: [footer](docs/editorial-footer-desktop.png), [contact](docs/editorial-contact-desktop.png), [skills](docs/editorial-skills-desktop.png), [tools](docs/editorial-tools-desktop.png), [technical domains](docs/editorial-domains-desktop.png), [journey](docs/editorial-journey-desktop.png) and [review layout](docs/editorial-reviews-desktop.png). Matching mobile captures use the same names with `-mobile.png`.

Latest follow-up: [editorial motion, responsive work filters and production setup diagnostics](docs/EDITORIAL_UPGRADE.md). Actual current checks and deployment limits are in [VERIFICATION.md](VERIFICATION.md).

# Elvora: supplied-reference design adaptation

Latest agency completion (17 October): the established design is retained. Shared CSS word/card reveals replace per-word Framer instances, with interactive motion preserved. About uses original brand art; unapproved review previews are hidden. Service/project detail pages, FAQs and the lead/CMS dashboard extend the same design. See `AGENCY_AUDIT.md`.

## Latest editorial feature update

The latest batch adds nine reference images. These features are implemented in Elvora’s existing gold/violet visual identity, with a deliberate ivory contact panel. Earlier compositions below describe the previous design phase.

| New visual reference                          | Current Elvora adaptation                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Oversized footer with pill navigation         | Three-column invitation, Quick links and actual email; filled cropped ELVORA lettering with a slow shine                    |
| Ivory “Let’s talk” invitation                 | Large editorial heading, direct email, accessible GitHub/Instagram icon buttons and the existing validated form             |
| Categorized skills rows                       | Six ruled rows for AI tools, prompts, web interfaces, APIs/data, voice and development tools                                |
| Sliding Wall of Love                          | One active horizontal review, cropped neighbouring cards, pause/previous/next and keyboard arrows                           |
| Technical Domains bento                       | Five asymmetrical cards for interfaces, integrations, data, deployment and conversational AI, with relevant technology tags |
| Wave-separated social footer                  | Layered animated violet waves, an Elvora emblem, owner-supplied social links, legal links, cookie settings and copyright    |
| Oversized experience heading and entries      | Two-tone MY JOURNEY heading and four owner-supplied chapters; no borrowed employment dates or experience totals             |
| Premium tools directory                       | Two-tone CREATIVE TOOLKIT heading, eight icon/role tiles and local brand assets                                             |
| Asymmetrical testimonial cards and star field | Soft star pattern and different card proportions merged with the one-review-at-a-time carousel                              |

All named tools, domains and journey facts come from the existing portfolio content and implemented stack. Reference hardware/networking skills, employers, reviews and metrics have not been attributed to the owner. No paid tool subscription or affiliation is implied. Simple Icons assets are bundled locally with attribution in `public/tool-marks/SOURCES.md`; Botpress uses a text identifier.

The carousel is ready for real reviews and approved portraits through `data/studio.ts`. Until supplied, its entries are labeled layout previews with neutral profile icons. No reference people or fabricated five-star ratings are used. Review rotation pauses on hover/focus, when the page is hidden and under reduced-motion preferences.

`app/editorial.css` scopes the new layouts; `ToolMark` shares the tool art between the directory and skill rows. No new runtime package or tracking integration is added. The contact recipient, validation, rate limits and privacy controls are retained.

Desktop/mobile captures use the `docs/editorial-` prefix: tools, skills, domains, journey, reviews, contact and footer. These supersede the corresponding older reference captures.

## Earlier supplied-reference phase

The owner supplied seven images in this update; two show the same footer family. They are now available and were used to adapt the structure, spacing and card language. The latest implementation supersedes the earlier original layouts made before these images were received.

| Supplied visual               | Elvora adaptation                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rounded 2×2 service grid      | Four supplied services, centered section heading, gold icon circles, quiet tags, contact links and charcoal rounded cards                                        |
| Five connected workflow cards | All five supplied AI-powered website steps in a horizontal sequence on desktop and readable cards on mobile                                                      |
| Vertical experience timeline  | Four owner-supplied journey chapters, gold timeline dots, phase badges and factual bullets; no invented dates or numeric success claims                          |
| Portrait-left About block     | Portrait frame on the left and a concise story/AI philosophy on the right; no copied person/photo or statistic cards                                             |
| Feedback card family          | Rounded charcoal review card with decorative offset cards; the requested one-at-a-time carousel and controls are retained                                        |
| Three-column footer           | Elvora identity, Navigation and Connect columns, owner-supplied GitHub/Instagram/email, and a compact legal/copyright row; the animated closing wordmark remains |

The real personal portrait and genuine approved review copy/client portraits remain pending. The About image and testimonial previews remain honestly labeled. Other people's reference testimonials, faces, locations, dates and accomplishments are not reused as the owner's facts.

## Motion

`TextReveal` uses clipped word masks, staggered spring transitions and one-time viewport entry. `Reveal` adds a short blur/scale/vertical transition to cards and image blocks. The existing logo shine, orbit, screenshot hover and scroll drift provide additional motion. Reduced-motion preferences disable these entrances, and a noscript style keeps headings and content visible without JavaScript.

The Framer URL `https://majd-portfolio.framer.website/` returned CONNECT/HTTP 403 from this environment again. Its exact live easing, sequence and timing could not be inspected or verified. The implementation matches the described pop-up/reveal behavior and supplied static composition; it does not claim an exact measured animation copy.

## My bunch of work

The separate collage below Selected Work now combines four existing concept website captures with six new coded UI studies. All are labeled concept work. No additional client count or commissioned-work claim is implied.

| UI study   | Route                | Art direction                                | Actual screenshot         |
| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| noma       | `/studies/noma`      | Sage/ivory financial dashboard               | `/studies/noma.webp`      |
| ORBIT      | `/studies/orbit`     | Violet/dark AI analytics                     | `/studies/orbit.webp`     |
| elsewhere. | `/studies/elsewhere` | Coastal travel editorial                     | `/studies/elsewhere.webp` |
| FORM /     | `/studies/form`      | Graphite/orange fitness and sculptural rings | `/studies/form.webp`      |
| offscript. | `/studies/offscript` | Cream/coral creative typography              | `/studies/offscript.webp` |
| aura       | `/studies/aura`      | Lilac/serif beauty and CSS product art       | `/studies/aura.webp`      |

These are interface presentations with fictional brands, balances, metrics and products. Their navigation/CTA links lead to design details or back to the portfolio. They do not submit financial transactions, appointments or orders. Travel imagery reuses the disclosed original generated Solenne scene; other illustrations/charts/products are original CSS/SVG. Screenshots are captured from the actual pages, not substituted generated website pictures.

Copy and themes live in `data/studies.ts` and `data/studio.ts`. `components/design-study.tsx` and `app/studies/studies.css` implement the six designs. The reusable collage uses the existing project records plus those studies; no schema migration or extra credentials are required.

Capture from an existing local app using `CAPTURE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3008 npx tsx scripts/capture-studies.ts`, or stop other Next.js processes and run `npx tsx scripts/capture-studies.ts` to start/stop its own temporary server. It uses a 1440×900 viewport at 2× resolution and writes six WebP files plus `public/studies/capture.json`. Do not run a build and development server against the same `.next` output simultaneously.

## SCREENSHOTS.md

``````md
# Current concept-site screenshots

Selected Work contains exactly four new custom concepts. Each gallery uses actual Chromium screenshots of its working Next.js demo. The imagery within those pages is original AI-generated fictional imagery plus original SVG illustrations; it does not depict real client work. The Elvora external/promotional card has been removed.

Desktop: 1440×900 at 2× (2880×1800). Mobile: 390×844 at 2× (780×1688). `npm run capture` captures these four selected demos. The hero assets are optimized WebP files in `public/concepts/`; their complete generation prompts are in `data/concept-images.ts`.

| Project      | Route           | Industry       |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------------- |
| Solenne      | `/demo/solenne` | Boutique hotel |
| Vanta Motors | `/demo/vanta`   | Automotive     |
| Aster Care   | `/demo/aster`   | Private clinic |
| Kovo Studio  | `/demo/kovo`    | Architecture   |

## Capture

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
npm run capture
```

If the app is already running, set `CAPTURE_BASE_URL` to its local origin. Stop development before a production build because both use `.next`. Capture opens fresh pages so filters and forms begin in their default states. Each `{slug}-capture.json` records route, viewport and method.

## Archived assets

The original restaurant/real-estate/SaaS/store demos and prior Elvora promotional image are retained as archived assets, without appearing in the selected grid or current sitemap. They are not silently deleted from an owner database. For database mode, unpublish older project records and add the four current entries, or use `CONTENT_SOURCE=files`.

## Additional UI-study collage assets

Six actual 1440×900 browser captures at 2× resolution now live in `public/studies/`: `noma.webp`, `orbit.webp`, `elsewhere.webp`, `form.webp`, `offscript.webp` and `aura.webp`. They show the original coded `/studies/[slug]` pages with fictional demo content. Refresh with `npx tsx scripts/capture-studies.ts`; stop other Next.js processes first or provide `CAPTURE_BASE_URL`. These are separate from the four complete selected concept websites and their 16-image galleries.

## Earlier editorial portfolio previews

`docs/editorial-{tools,skills,domains,journey,reviews,contact,footer}-{desktop,mobile}.png` capture the earlier editorial portfolio sections at 1440px and 390px. They show the implemented Elvora designs, not the reference uploads. Reduced-motion capture mode reveals every heading/card, and fixed navigation is hidden for unobstructed section previews. Review/profile placeholders remain clearly identified. Earlier `reference-` and `studio-` captures document previous design phases.

## Agency completion previews — 17 October 2026

`docs/agency-{home,about,faq,contact,service,project}-{desktop,mobile}.png` are twelve actual production-build public captures at 1440px/390px. They show original brand About artwork, genuine supplied content, FAQs and service/project notes. Fixed widgets are hidden only during unobstructed section captures. Reduced motion is used for still images; motion is separately verified in the browser.

`docs/agency-admin-{dashboard,inbox}-{desktop,mobile}.png` show actual local PostgreSQL-backed admin pages. Inbox material is explicitly named temporary QA fixture data, not customer information. Fixture records were removed after testing. These captures do not establish a live production database or deployment.

The ordinary public site hides reviews until genuine permission-approved records exist; earlier review-preview images are historical. `docs/agency-performance.json` records the current local mobile Lighthouse result and limits.

## SECURITY_STATUS.md

``````md
# Dependency and application security status — 17 October 2026

The owner approved the major-version migration. The project now uses **Next.js 15.5.28** and matching ESLint configuration with React 18.3.1. Async `headers()` and dynamic route parameters, tracing and external-package configuration were migrated. Lint, TypeScript, production build, real PostgreSQL/Auth.js HTTPS integration and browser checks cover the upgrade.

Current `npm audit --omit=dev`: **0 vulnerabilities**. The earlier Next.js 14 launch blocker has been resolved by the approved migration. This is an audit snapshot, not a guarantee against all vulnerabilities.

The full development audit reports **7 high-severity affected entries** through `braces <=3.0.3` and its glob/watch consumers in ESLint and Tailwind. No patched braces version is published in the available registry. These are build/development dependencies, not a finding in the production-only dependency tree. Do not process untrusted glob patterns through those tools. Review upstream releases and re-audit before launch; the finding is not suppressed or relabeled as fixed.

Existing security updates and overrides remain: Auth.js/NextAuth 4.24.15, Prisma 6.19.3, Sharp 0.35.5, Blob 2.8.2, PostCSS 8.5.30, deepmerge-ts 8.0.2, uuid 11.1.1 and postcss-selector-parser 7.1.6. The Gmail SMTP implementation uses patched Nodemailer 10.1.1 as the `gmail-smtp` alias. This Credentials-only app does not enable Auth.js's optional email authentication provider.

Application controls include server page/API authorization, 15-minute absolute session limits, database password-version checks, revocation on logout/password/2FA changes, bcrypt hashes and byte limits, failed-login lockout, shared-store production rate limits, same-origin mutation checks, strict validation, nonced CSP, no-store private responses and restricted image upload decoding/re-encoding. Sign-out revokes all sessions for the single administrator. Recovery is a private CLI operation, with audit records; there is no public registration/reset endpoint.

Production still requires a strong private auth secret, HTTPS, least-privilege database access, backups, shared Redis limits for multiple instances, properly configured Turnstile, and actual provider configuration. Memory limits are an explicit single-process deployment option only. Review retention, provider agreements and served regions; consent controls do not certify legal compliance.

Recheck after dependency or authentication changes:

```bash
npm audit --omit=dev
npm audit
npm run test:chat
npm run test:contact
npm run test:security
npm run test:consent
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

See `TESTING.md` for guarded real-database and HTTPS integration suites. No actual production credentials, database, mail delivery, paid AI call or public hosting deployment is established by local tests.

Owner-login follow-up: missing setup and infrastructure errors now stay visible, and dashboard navigation requires an established authorized cookie. Private one-time build activation is opt-in, skipped for previews, preserves existing credentials and exposes no public setup endpoint. This does not supply real hosting credentials or prove public owner activation; see `OWNER_LOGIN.md`.
``````

## TESTING.md

``````md
# Verification workflow

Node 24 was used. Install with the lockfile, retain Prisma/security overrides and do not run dev and build concurrently.

```bash
npm ci --cache /tmp/portfoli-npm-cache --no-audit --no-fund
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:chat
npm run test:contact
npm run test:security
npm run test:consent
npm run test:login
npm run build
npm audit --omit=dev
npm audit
```

The unit suites verify guards, quotas, provider adapters, safe SMTP, durable-storage failure semantics, schemas, TOTP/encryption, real image decoding and consent expiry. Provider requests in those tests are explicit fixtures; no real mail or paid AI request is sent. The full development audit currently has an upstream finding documented in `SECURITY_STATUS.md`; it must not be reported as a passing zero-vulnerability check.

## Opt-in real PostgreSQL and HTTPS integration

Use a disposable local PostgreSQL database and generated test-only admin/auth secrets in an ignored private environment file outside the repository. Never use production data or credentials. The auth suite additionally requires a loopback database URL whose database name begins `elvora_agency_test` and resets only that fixture admin when cleaning up.

1. Set private `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` for that isolated database. Run the actual migration CLI, bootstrap and deliberate development seed. Confirm repeated bootstrap is refused and production demo seed is refused.
2. Set `AGENCY_TEST_DATABASE=isolated`, `NEXTAUTH_URL=https://127.0.0.1:3443`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to that test origin, `CONTENT_SOURCE=database`, `CONTACT_STORAGE=database`. Leave real SMTP, AI and storage credentials absent.
3. For this single-process fixture only, enable `AUTH_ALLOW_IN_MEMORY_LIMITER=true`, `CONTACT_ALLOW_IN_MEMORY_LIMITER=true`, `CONTACT_TURNSTILE_REQUIRED=false`. The auth suite varies local `x-real-ip` fixture headers with `AUTH_TRUSTED_IP_HEADER=x-real-ip` to exercise multiple session transitions without waiting through the shared login bucket. This is a test setting, not evidence of a trusted production proxy.
4. Create a self-signed certificate with localhost/127.0.0.1 SANs. Set `AGENCY_TEST_TLS=self-signed-local`, `AGENCY_TEST_TLS_KEY` and `AGENCY_TEST_TLS_CERT` to the private local files.
5. Run the production build without fixture credentials embedded in it, then start the production app with the private fixture environment on port 3008. In another persistent terminal run `npm run test:proxy` with the same fixture environment. The helper binds loopback, forwards only to loopback and refuses use outside the explicitly isolated fixture.
6. Run suites sequentially with the same private environment:

```bash
node --env-file=/private/path/test.env --test --test-concurrency=1 tests/agency.integration.mjs
node --env-file=/private/path/test.env --test --test-concurrency=1 tests/auth.integration.mjs
```

The agency suite covers unauthorized verbs/pages/uploads, actual credential login, Secure/HttpOnly/Strict cookies, origin/schema rejection, CMS publication, sitemap, stored inquiries, status/notes/search/pagination/audit, logout and captured-token replay rejection. The auth suite covers authenticator confirmation, password-only rejection, 2FA disabling, password changes and session revocation. The only certificate-validation exception in the test client is guarded by the explicit local self-signed fixture; application production cookies and TLS settings are not weakened.

Stop only your fixture app/proxy/database after testing. Restart the ordinary app without those credentials/settings. These tests create temporary local content and test accounts; they do not prove production configuration, external service delivery or deployment success.

## Browser and performance review

Use system Chromium or a compatible Playwright browser. Check public/admin layouts at 360, 390, 768, 1024 and 1440px, themes, keyboard navigation, accessible dialogs, form errors/success/reset, lead editing, genuine review carousel controls, reduced motion and JavaScript-off content. Under CSP, inject axe with the page's script nonce. Scan after theme transitions/reveal effects settle; do not hide genuine contrast failures.

Verify consent defaults off, saved rejection, explicit embed creation, cross-tab permission revocation and frame teardown, storage failures and preference reopening. An explicit local iframe fixture can verify consent behavior without invoking the real provider; label that evidence accordingly.

Run Lighthouse alone against a production server in ordinary file mode. Save the actual score, device/throttling settings and metrics; don't substitute a previous result or certify the public deployment from a local audit. Capture helpers may hide fixed navigation/skip-link widgets only in screenshots. `VERIFICATION.md` records measured outcomes and `docs/` contains actual captures.

Owner login regression checks cover missing setup, safe credential/outage/rate errors, CSRF submission, callback success with blocked cookies, and malformed responses. Private build activation is opt-in, skips previews, and must be tested against a separate empty disposable database. Verify first owner creation, repeat-run password preservation and removal of the temporary password; never test it against production incidentally.

For `npm run test:login:browser`, provide the guarded isolated HTTPS fixture environment and `AGENCY_TEST_UNCONFIGURED_URL` pointing to a separate ordinary loopback app without auth settings. It verifies the setup notice, business-email prefill, wrong password, real owner dashboard login/logout, an explicitly dropped session cookie, safe failure messaging and old error-query handling. It uses system Chromium or `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE`. No real credential is embedded in the test.

To regress the CMS-metadata outage bug, stop only the disposable local PostgreSQL instance while its fixture app/proxy remain running, then run `AGENCY_TEST_DATABASE_UNAVAILABLE=true node --env-file=/private/path/test.env tests/admin-database-outage.browser.mjs`. This must still render sign-in and report its actual database failure inline; restart the fixture database before other suites. Never stop a production database for this check.

## Editorial motion and private setup regression

`npm run test:motion:browser` uses `PUBLIC_TEST_URL` (default loopback port 3008) and system Chromium. It checks six viewport widths, themes, actual filter contents, live OS motion changes, explicit animation preference persistence, native touch behavior, lazy AI demos, form validation, overflow, no-JavaScript content and browser errors. It refuses nonlocal targets.

`node --env-file=/private/path/local-test.env tests/owner-setup.integration.mjs` requires `AGENCY_TEST_DATABASE=isolated` and an explicitly local PostgreSQL connection on port 55432. It creates/drops its own disposable database, runs real private build setup, verifies weak credential diagnostics, first-owner creation and repeat-run preservation, and never prints generated fixture secrets. It must never be run against a real production database.

## VERIFICATION.md

``````md
# Verification — 17 October 2026

This records the current **local production build**. It does not establish that the external hosting deployment, real provider credentials or live inbox delivery work. The approved Next.js 15.5.28 migration resolves the earlier Next.js 14 production audit blocker. Remaining development-tool findings are documented separately.

## Current homepage: contrasting sections

Final three-skill review: Emil, Apple HIG and Liquid Glass coexist as 17 uniquely named development skills. The owner selected a new runtime for actual WebGL refraction behind native navigation controls. Scoped CSS/solid fallbacks, a pinned local package with the upstream broken install hook removed, and clean install/ci verification are included. Lint, production build, nine WebGL cases, eight Apple control cases, Emil regressions and all five video-loop/fallback checks passed. Four focused axe scans reported no detected violations, with contrast checks explicitly marked incomplete and supplemented by measured token bounds. Physical-device performance and live deployment remain unverified. See [all three integrations, exact changes, previews, evidence and costs](docs/THREE_SKILLS_FINAL_REVIEW.md).

Apple HIG integration: the pinned upstream skill and references are installed as `apple-hig-design`, preserving Emil’s separate `apple-design` skill. All 133 imported file hashes and sixteen unique skill names are verified. Lint, production build and eight browser cases (320/390/768/1440px, both themes) passed: chat fixture reply, modal Tab/Escape/focus restoration, touch sizing, keyboard ring, contrast/transparency preferences and no overflow. These checks use local Chromium; actual AI replies, physical phones and live deployment are not established. See [the focused review and exact changes](docs/APPLE_HIG_INTEGRATION.md).

Emil skills audit: all 15 supplied skills are installed as development-only Markdown, with original license/provenance. Saved Motion Off now starts zero video requests (previously three); On retains one responsive source per clip and eager readiness. Shared touch controls, native theme-color synchronization and offscreen footer pausing are verified. Lint, production build, 320/390/768/1440px quality checks, all five showcase loops/fallbacks and categorized-page checks passed. No physical-phone, FPS, PageSpeed or live-deployment claim is made. See [audit and execution record](docs/EMIL_SKILLS_AUDIT.md).

Legal metadata follow-up: Cookie, Privacy and Terms pages now define their own descriptions and social metadata instead of inheriting homepage marketing copy. Lint, production build and HTTP 200 HTML checks for all three legal routes plus the homepage passed, including descriptions, canonicals and indexability. Policy text and consent behavior are unchanged. Live deployment remains unverified.

Latest copy/SEO update: the homepage explains custom websites and business-data chatbots for international clients in plain English. Homepage, Websites and AI Bots titles/descriptions are distinct and verified in server HTML, including social tags and canonicals. Lint, production build and desktop/mobile page checks passed. Original visuals and behavior remain unchanged. The owner's supplied PageSpeed report is reviewed with prioritized recommendations; no performance changes or fresh score are claimed. See [the copy and audit record](docs/SEO_COPY_AND_PAGESPEED_REVIEW.md).

Latest update: the exact portrait extracted from the owner's PDF replaces the About poster text inside its original frame. The rotating collection video has a transparent outer background and a purple MP4 fallback for browsers without alpha support. Native decoded pixels, forced fallback, transparent Motion Off poster, portrait framing and both themes were verified; four About WCAG A/AA scans found zero violations. See [current details and previews](docs/PORTRAIT_TRANSPARENT_COLLECTION.md). Local production build passed; live deployment remains unverified.

The static Bunch of Work homepage collage is replaced by the owner's eight-second rotating-design video. Its local desktop/mobile encodes use a rounded 16:9 frame and the shared motion-controlled player. Production build and native checks for all five showcases passed at 390/1440px, covering actual looping, silent inline playback, no controls, rounded corners, Off/On and offscreen pause. The dedicated collection wall and its destination remain unchanged. See [current video frames](docs/HOMEPAGE_BANDS.md#homepage-collection-video).

Latest refinement: the website video spans more than 90% of the viewport and blends into black with contained, undistorted source framing. Both homepage videos have rounded bottom corners. Keep exploring gains bold type, purple emphasis, visible-only accent motion and clear hover/focus states. Production build, six-width/both-theme checks, all four native loops and desktop/mobile motion checks passed; six WCAG A/AA scans including desktop hover found zero violations. See [current details and previews](docs/HOMEPAGE_BANDS.md#video-edges-and-highlighted-navigation).

The homepage Websites screenshot is replaced with the owner's ten-second architectural video, in a natural 16:9 frame with four rounded corners. Local silent desktop/mobile WebM/MP4 files and a matching poster use the shared motion-controlled player. Production build and native browser checks cover all four showcases, looping, inline/no-controls playback, responsive sources, rounded clipping, Off/On and offscreen pause. See [current frames](docs/HOMEPAGE_BANDS.md#homepage-websites-video).

The homepage AI Bots image is replaced with the owner's eight-second delivery-chat video, using local silent desktop/mobile WebM and MP4 files. Production build passed. Native browser checks verified all three showcases at 390/1440px, actual looping, muted inline playback, no controls, global Off/On and offscreen pause; the homepage card retains its size and destination. See [desktop and phone frames](docs/HOMEPAGE_BANDS.md#homepage-ai-bots-video).

The homepage now uses a light purpose section, a full-width black website showcase, a white/deep-purple split for AI Bots and Bunch of Work, and light secondary navigation. The header and hero still follow the saved light/dark theme. Purple links and primary actions use the existing palette. Scoped section variables come from the shared token source; other pages and custom artwork are preserved.

Production build, ten-subject-page navigation, six-width/both-theme layouts (now explicitly including the homepage), saved Motion Off and desktop/mobile logo/reading checks passed. Four current WCAG A/AA scans cover the complete homepage in both themes at 390/1440px with zero violations. See [current previews and verification](docs/HOMEPAGE_BANDS.md). Live hosting remains unverified here.

## Previous revision: website positioning and floating Testimonials

The website category is now Websites at `/websites`. Its projects, original How I Build Websites process and Technical Domains appear in that order, with local navigation links. The former AI Websites and standalone domain routes redirect to the appropriate destination. About has four profile tabs. Conventional development tools lead Skills & Tools; AI is described as selective assistance. About explains that effective use requires experience, coding foundations, database knowledge and careful review.

Testimonials now has original illustrated fictional profiles, clearly labeled illustrative reviews, subtle floating cards and background particles. The section supports phones, visible-only activity, local pause/resume, desktop hover pause, global Motion Off and static no-JavaScript content. Genuine published and permission-approved records replace the samples; publication filtering is unchanged. The original footer, curved artwork wall, device models, custom demo colors, video behavior, consent, Botpress and private credentials are preserved.

Production build (including lint and TypeScript), ten-subject-page navigation checks, six-width/both-theme motion checks, testimonial replacement/motion checks, logo/reading motion, native looping video and interactive demo-window checks passed. Twenty current WCAG A/AA scans across five affected pages, two themes and two widths found no violations. See [implementation, previews and reproduction commands](docs/WEBSITES_TESTIMONIALS.md). Earlier reports below describe earlier revisions. Live hosting and owner login remain unverified.

## Previous revision: restored footer, homepage and subject-page processes

The original footer component is restored (wordmark, waves, emblem, socials and original layout); its differences from the pre-categorization version are routing fixes and eager logo loading. Website-building remains below the website projects. The AI Bots page includes the bot-building process and all original embedding methods; former process-only URLs redirect to these inline sections. About tabs contain five genuine profile topics. The homepage now has a clear purpose, large visual pathways and a scoped black/white theme that preserves light/dark switching. Other custom page designs, project art, media and consent logic are preserved.

The production build, lint/types, subject-page/navigation suite, six-width/both-theme suite, native showcase playback, gallery/certificate/FAQ checks and logo/reading checks pass. The route suite checks eleven subject pages, footer restoration, inline process order, local anchors, aliases, canonical URLs, sitemap, no-JavaScript content and mobile 3D. See [latest evidence](docs/RESTORED_HOMEPAGE.md). Older single-page and compact-footer reports below describe earlier revisions. Live Vercel deployment remains unverified here.

## Current categorized pages and clean project previews

The public homepage now contains only the hero and a page directory. Thirteen separate content routes, including the AI Bots embedding sub-page, share route-aware desktop/mobile navigation. Profile tabs follow About → Journey → Technical Domains → Skills & Tools → Certificates → How I Build. The original curved wall has a larger dedicated page; Testimonials has its own editorial card layout. Project cards retain the original device models/artwork while removing white panels, counters and metadata clutter. Mobile device previews gain visible-only floating and scroll-linked 3D transforms without replacing native touch scrolling.

Production build, lint and TypeScript pass. Browser checks cover all thirteen routes with JavaScript and without it, canonical URLs, sitemap, legacy section links, mobile/desktop keyboard navigation, active states, both themes at six widths, mobile 3D, both looping videos, four interactive demo forms/windows, galleries, certificates, contact validation, FAQ, reading and logo motion. The testimonial harness verifies that approved records replace explicitly labeled sample cards. Consent/contact/chat/security suites pass all 46 tests. Twenty-four WCAG A/AA scans across six page types, two themes and two widths found zero violations. See [page map and evidence](docs/CATEGORIZED_PAGES.md), [accessibility results](docs/pages-accessibility.json) and [page loading observations](docs/pages-scroll-readiness.json). These local checks do not prove live Vercel deployment, private service delivery or owner login. Prior single-page loading counts and Lighthouse measurements below are historical.

## Latest playback, window navigation and page readiness

Both videos now loop without player controls on desktop and phones, with responsive phone encodes and global Motion Off. This follows the owner's explicit update and supersedes the previous mobile-poster/AI-once behavior. Sample cards open actual interactive framed websites; the separate Work studies category is removed while the custom photo wall and study routes remain. Core content, images and interface code load before scrolling/interactions; viewport entrance gating is removed. Native video, all four demo forms/window controls, dialogs/FAQ, both themes and six widths passed. The loading check found all 67 images ready before scrolling and zero scroll-started image/component-script requests. Raw frame observations include occasional long frames; no physical-device 60fps claim is made. Public portfolio/window-chrome A/AA scans found zero violations. See [current evidence, previews and reproduction commands](docs/READY_PLAYBACK_UPDATE.md). Public-domain verification was blocked by this environment's DNS/HTTP proxy; live hosting/provider/owner-login success remains unverified.

## Current purple palette and local showcase videos

The shared UI now uses the owner-specified purple tokens in both themes, with neutral large typography and no purple gradients. Custom project artwork, device designs, lower layouts and the curved photo wall retain their geometry/content/colors. Work and AI Bots have local WebM/MP4 showcases with visibility-based play/pause, an AI once/replay flow, and poster-only behavior below 768px or under reduced motion. No new library or consent/Botpress changes were introduced.

Pending follow-ups are also complete: Motion defaults to On (saved Off persists), and Testimonials uses the supplied four-card composition with explicit layout samples when approved feedback is absent. This supersedes the older carousel/invitation behavior described below. Current build/lint/types, native media browser checks, six-width/both-theme regressions, logo/reading/gallery/FAQ checks, five consent tests and five login tests passed. Desktop/mobile WCAG A/AA scans in both themes found zero violations; token text/button contrast is at least 4.66:1. See [the complete file list, final token table and evidence](docs/PURPLE_VIDEO_UPDATE.md).

The supplied Vercel log still identifies first-owner `ADMIN_PASSWORD` symbol validation as the production blocker. No credentials, authenticator settings or backend rules were changed. Local success is not verification of a live production deployment or owner login. Earlier performance figures below are historical.

## Motion from the supplied video

The 19.38-second reference shows a profile flip and progressive reading emphasis; it does not include its testimonials section. Elvora's existing logo now has a two-face scroll-linked flip and visible-only shine on desktop/touch. Hero/About/selected introduction copy gains reversible word emphasis using one inline word element plus a CSS ink layer, with stable widths, an accessible full-text copy and native no-JavaScript readability. Minor icon/arrow feedback is gated by motion preferences.

The review carousel now has angled preview cards, larger quotes, word-staggered transitions, touch swipe, interval-preserving pause/resume and viewport/focus/visibility/reduced-motion controls. No genuine reviews were supplied to file mode: the public page shows an explicit invitation state. QA records exist only in a separate loopback component harness; CMS permission/publication filtering is unchanged.

Production build (including lint/types) passed. Six-width/both-theme browser checks, gallery/FAQ interaction checks and new desktop/touch logo/reading checks passed. The actual review component passed next/keyboard navigation, timed advance, focus/hover pause, OS reduced motion and swipe checks with local QA data. Desktop/mobile axe scans in both themes found zero WCAG A/AA violations. No fresh Lighthouse/field-INP/physical-device-60fps claim is made. Credentials and live hosting were not changed or verified. See [implementation and test details](docs/VIDEO_MOTION_UPDATE.md).

## Contact palette and project presentation follow-up

The contact section now follows dark/light theme palettes instead of always showing a white panel. Website concepts use a wider staggered editorial layout with larger device previews, clearer titles and fewer nested borders. Mobile remains one column; categories, galleries, form behavior and the curved work wall are preserved. Production build/lint/types and both responsive/motion browser suites passed, covering six widths and both themes. Desktop/mobile axe scans in both themes found zero WCAG A/AA violations, including after contact validation. See [the presentation change record and screenshots](docs/PRESENTATION_UPDATE.md). Lighthouse was not rerun for this follow-up; no earlier measurement should be presented as a fresh score. Production hosting and owner setup remain unverified.

## Password typing and optional authenticator correction

The reported disabled-password behavior was reproduced: all login inputs were disabled when aggregate server configuration was incomplete. Email and password now stay editable, with password show/hide and a separate website-password hint. Submission remains guarded until setup is ready. The optional authenticator field is collapsed behind a native disclosure, with explicit instructions that it only applies after enabling 2FA in Security. Server-side password and TOTP validation remain unchanged.

Connected Upstash integrations supplied `KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`, while owner readiness, build setup and login rate limiting previously recognized only custom AUTH/CHAT names. All three now share one server-side resolver supporting AUTH, CHAT, KV and native UPSTASH pairs, in that order. Partial explicit pairs do not fall back or borrow tokens; read-only tokens are not accepted. No variables, passwords, owners or 2FA settings were overwritten.

Production build (including lint/types), 12 security tests and 5 login tests passed. A real Chromium production check at 360/1440px verifies typing, password reveal, optional code, unavailable-setup submission guard, no overflow and zero browser errors. A separate local dummy KV-only runtime enables the form, permits submission with a blank authenticator and preserves typed details on a simulated infrastructure error. This is not a successful real provider/owner login. Mobile login axe scan found zero WCAG A/AA violations; screenshot: `docs/login-fields-mobile.png`. `npm run test:login-fields:browser` reproduces the unconfigured UI regression check. Hosting deployment and real owner activation remain unverified.

## Uploaded brief completion — prior public frontend measurement

This is the newest frontend measurement and supersedes earlier scores below for the current build. See [the complete brief report](docs/BRIEF_COMPLETION.md) and [measured data](docs/brief-performance.json).

- 22 active project/study WebP sources reduced from 3,203,846 to 1,367,634 bytes (57%), with 23 tiny local blur placeholders; certificate source unchanged.
- Shared scroll stream now includes velocity and back-to-top. Desktop parallax, velocity marquees, background wash and short visual curtain respect motion settings. Native touch scrolling and the curved work wall remain.
- Native, server-rendered FAQ progressively loads its animation module near the viewport, with keyboard, rapid-reversal, reduced-motion and no-JavaScript coverage. All other new animation uses transforms/opacity; FAQ height is the brief's explicit exception.
- Production build, lint/type checks and both browser suites passed. Six widths (360–1920px), both themes, desktop and touch, category filters, four on-demand demos, forms, dialogs and motion preference changes passed. Desktop/mobile axe scans found zero WCAG A/AA violations.
- Latest isolated Lighthouse mobile run: **93 performance / 100 accessibility / 100 best practices / 100 SEO**; FCP **1.4s**, LCP **3.2s**, TBT **10ms**, CLS **0**, speed index **1.7s**. Inline CSS removed render-blocking stylesheet requests. The requested 95+ and LCP <2s targets remain unmet; field INP and physical-device 60fps are unmeasured.
- No provider credentials or live hosting configuration were changed. Real owner login, production build activation and provider delivery remain unverified here.

## Curved work wall and website workflow

The newer visual-only follow-up replaces the flat bunch-of-work grid with a CSS 3D curved wall and an accessible ten-destination index, respecting existing motion preferences and both themes. The workflow is retitled **How I Build Websites.**, adds the requested custom-trained AI task explanation and uses a new editorial process layout. Production build, lint, types and six-width/both-theme browser checks passed; sampled section accessibility scans found zero WCAG A/AA violations. See [the specific change record and screenshots](docs/SHOWCASE_UPDATE.md). The previous Lighthouse measurement below was not rerun for this follow-up and must not be represented as its current measured score.

## Editorial/motion follow-up and reported Vercel failure

The supplied production log confirms the terminating error is first-owner email/password validation, after successful migrations and an owner-table query. It is not the npm deprecation warnings or SSL compatibility warning. The updated private build script reports the unmet password rules separately from an invalid email. It validates copied connection URLs and emits only fixed, non-secret driver diagnostics. Existing owners/passwords remain untouched. Production still requires the owner to correct the private Production credential and redeploy; this workspace has no callable authenticated Vercel tool.

The current front end has four work categories, a combined skills/toolkit, accessible Motion Auto/On/Off controls, responsive reveals, lazy fine-pointer Lenis enhancement, native touch scrolling, desktop View/magnetic effects, direction-aware/active navigation, stacked mobile workflow, journey/reading progress and floating form labels. CSS scroll-linked timelines that hung Chromium during preference changes have been replaced by one shared passive listener/frame. Native OS reduced motion is the default; full motion requires explicit On when the OS requests less. Two variable font files replace five initial files from the same two families. Privacy controls use system fonts so they do not wait on branded downloads.

Validation for this follow-up:

- Production build, lint and type checking passed.
- Security **10**, login **5**, chat **16**, contact **13**, consent **5** unit tests: **49 passed**.
- Separate disposable PostgreSQL test verified actual migrations and owner creation, weak/missing requirements, invalid email/URL diagnostics, no password output and repeat-run preservation of exact existing password hashes. The disposable database was removed after the test.
- Responsive production browser suite covers **360,390,768,1024,1440,1920px**, both themes, filtering, live reduced-motion changes, explicit On/Off, persisted choice after reload, navigation/overflow, no-JavaScript text, no unsolicited AI traffic and no runtime/hydration errors. Additional touch-native, AI demo and form-validation checks are included in the same script.
- Desktop and mobile axe WCAG A/AA checks: **0 violations**. Screenshots are `docs/editorial-*-hero.png` and `docs/editorial-*-work.png`.
- Local Lighthouse 13.5 mobile, fresh consent state: **95 performance / 100 accessibility / 100 best practices / 100 SEO**; FCP **1.4s**, LCP **2.9s**, TBT **30ms**, CLS **0**, speed index **1.6s**. See `docs/editorial-performance.json`. An intermediate follow-up build measured 90 performance before font/privacy-rendering changes. This is lab evidence, not a live score or measured field INP/60fps guarantee. The requested LCP below 2s remains unmet.
- Production dependency audit remains clean; no claim that the separate development-tool findings disappeared.

See [the implementation audit, full file map and test instructions](docs/EDITORIAL_UPGRADE.md). Earlier evidence below describes the previous agency/login implementation and must not be substituted for current metrics.

## Owner sign-in follow-up

The reported return-to-login behavior was reproduced locally with missing private authentication settings. Auth.js's client helper can navigate to its error route when provider discovery fails, leaving the custom login screen apparently unchanged. The public hosting request was blocked by this cloud network's CONNECT policy; production variables/database/account state were not inspected or changed.

Replaced that submission path with CSRF-protected credential submission that retains safe inline errors and verifies database-authorized session cookies before navigating. Added a setup-incomplete notice, business-email prefill, old error-query feedback, and distinct invalid-credential/outage/rate/cookie messages. Public CMS metadata now lives on the homepage rather than the shared root layout, so private sign-in can render independently of the CMS database. No secrets or account-existence details are exposed.

Added private opt-in `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_ON_BUILD` activation. Against a separate empty local PostgreSQL database, it applied reviewed migrations and created the business-email owner with a generated test-only password. Repeated runs preserved the account/hash, including with the temporary password removed. Preview and default-off paths were checked. No public registration/setup endpoint or automatic password reset was added. `OWNER_LOGIN.md` gives the remaining Vercel activation steps.

`test:login`: **5 passed**. Security suite now **8 passed**, including configuration readiness. Production build, lint and typecheck passed. Real Chromium HTTPS checks passed for the setup notice, actual business-owner dashboard login/logout, wrong-password feedback, dropped session-cookie feedback, safe outage/error-query messages and zero page/hydration errors. The actual API agency/auth suites were rerun against the new owner fixture. Stopping the actual disposable database exposed and then verified the root-metadata dependency fix: sign-in remains readable and shows a safe unavailable error without navigation or cleared input.

The earlier website performance/public screenshots below describe the agency build. Public rendering is unchanged by this admin-only follow-up; Lighthouse was not rerun for it. Live owner activation still requires private Vercel/database configuration and remains unverified.

## Install, framework and unit checks

- Fresh locked `npm ci --cache /tmp/portfoli-npm-cache --no-audit --no-fund` passed and generated the pinned Prisma JavaScript/WASM client.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` and the optimized Next.js 15.5.28 production build passed. Homepage first-load JavaScript is approximately 170 kB; service/project detail pages approximately 119 kB. The expected Open Graph edge-runtime static-generation notice is not a build failure.
- `npm run test:chat`: **16 passed**. Prompt/input/origin guards, provider contracts, quotas, controlled embeds and error handling.
- `npm run test:contact`: **13 passed**. Validation, fixed-recipient safe SMTP, missing credentials, origin/honeypot/quota behavior, optional fields, durable storage without SMTP, notification failure after acceptance and database failure without false success.
- `npm run test:security`: **8 passed**. Password byte rules, RFC 6238 TOTP vectors, authenticated encryption, strict content/connection/image schemas, Turnstile verification, actual image decoding/re-encoding, review publication permission and admin configuration readiness.
- `npm run test:login`: **5 passed**. Missing setup, safe login errors, CSRF submission, authorized cookie verification and malformed responses.
- `npm run test:consent`: **5 passed**. Malformed/expired/future/version handling, current accept/reject choices and equivalent initial-render visibility-script validation including blocked storage.
- Current production audit: **0 vulnerabilities**. Full audit: **7 high development-tool entries**, through unpatched braces/glob consumers. That full audit is not reported as clean.

## Actual PostgreSQL and production HTTPS

A disposable PostgreSQL 17.6 instance bound to loopback was used, with generated private test credentials and no production database. The actual Prisma migration CLI successfully applied both initial and additive agency migrations. First-admin bootstrap and development seed succeeded; repeated bootstrap and production demo seed were refused as intended.

`tests/agency.integration.mjs`: **8 passed** (including subtests). Actual Auth.js Credentials login and PostgreSQL queries were used. Verified unauthorized admin pages, all resource verbs and upload rejection; Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite=Strict cookies; same-origin and schema checks; FAQ/service publication and removal from public output/sitemap; durable inquiry storage without SMTP; lead search/status/notes/read; dashboard counts; audit pagination/no-store; and logout rejection of captured token replay.

`tests/auth.integration.mjs`: **4 passed** (including subtests). Verified actual authenticator setup/confirmation, incorrect code rejection, password-only rejection with 2FA enabled, fresh-code login, disabling 2FA, password changes, old-password rejection and session invalidation. The guarded suite restores only its disposable fixture admin.

The tracked loopback-only HTTPS proxy was exercised for these checks so application production Secure cookies remained enabled. Test certificate exceptions were restricted to the explicit self-signed local fixture. No production TLS setting was weakened. Temporary review/inquiry records were cleaned, and fixture app/proxy/database services were stopped after use.

## Browser, accessibility and content

- System Chromium checks passed for public layouts at **360, 390, 768, 1024 and 1440px**, with no document overflow. Admin inbox layouts passed the same sizes.
- Dark/light homepage, service/project details, preferences dialog, private dashboard, FAQ management and inbox passed axe WCAG A/AA scans after transitions settled. Mobile menu Escape/focus behavior and native FAQ mouse/Enter controls passed.
- Actual browser sign-in and FAQ create/save/delete/cancel were verified against the real local database. A list-label issue found during testing was fixed so FAQ questions display instead of IDs.
- The real contact form submitted optional company/service and a message into PostgreSQL, displayed accurate saved acceptance, reset the optional values, and exposed the inquiry in admin. Search, filtering, status, private notes and deletion were exercised through the UI.
- Consent banner exists in initial server HTML. Verified default-denied embeds, stored rejection, explicit permission before iframe creation, saved-choice suppression, cross-tab revocation and iframe teardown, preference reopening and blocked-storage feedback. The embedded provider response was an explicit local HTML fixture; it does not prove real Botpress replies.
- Verified viewport word reveal/mask movement, immediately readable hero, reduced motion and public text with JavaScript disabled. Moving the root streaming loader to the private admin route fixed hidden public content without JavaScript.
- Three temporary local CMS review fixtures verified timed rotation, hover/pause behavior, keyboard next, one active accessible slide and disabled autoplay under reduced motion. All fixtures were removed. The ordinary public site has no unapproved testimonials or fabricated faces.
- Fresh browser sessions reported no page/hydration errors. Twelve public and four private dashboard/inbox screenshots show actual rendered pages. Private screenshots use clearly named local QA fixtures, not real customer information. The original Elvora About composition replaces the substitute portrait; supplied certificate, project captures, actual email and social URLs remain intact.

## Local mobile Lighthouse

Fresh ordinary file-mode production server; Lighthouse 13.5.0, simulated mobile throttling, no concurrent browser/capture workload:

| Category       | Score |
| -------------- | ----: |
| Performance    |    92 |
| Accessibility  |   100 |
| Best practices |   100 |
| SEO            |   100 |

FCP **1.2 s**, LCP **3.3 s**, total blocking time **20 ms**, CLS **0**, speed index **1.2 s**. Shared CSS/observer reveals and initial consent rendering reduce hydration work. LCP remains above the 2.5-second good threshold in this simulated run. See `docs/agency-performance.json` for settings and numeric metrics. Scores vary with devices, CPU, network, content, providers and the production host; they are neither a security nor a legal certification. Earlier scores/captures describe older builds.

## Remaining real-world setup and limits

- Configure production PostgreSQL, migration access, auth secret and shared Redis limits; create the first admin privately with `npm run admin:bootstrap`. Populate reviewed CMS records before choosing database content mode. File mode remains the default; inquiry storage can be enabled independently.
- Configure actual Turnstile keys, Gmail sender/App Password, server-side AI key and optional Blob settings. Real SMTP mailbox delivery, paid AI/provider replies, Redis service, Blob upload and Turnstile challenges were not verified with real accounts.
- Preserve the supplied Botpress configuration and check provider publishing/domain permissions on the real host. Live external Framer timing, exact animation-copy parity and public deployment are not verified.
- Genuine review text/portrait permission and an optional personal photo must come from the owner. No client statistics, revenue, experience totals, success rates or business outcomes were invented.
- Verify public DNS/certificates/redirects, hosting deployment, backups/restoration, actual retention and served-region policy requirements. No DNS changes were made. Physical-device speech recognition/playback remains unverified.
- Saved cloud startup instructions are a configuration draft, separate from website deployment; review/save and publish environment settings to activate them for future tasks. Fresh-task restoration has not been independently verified.

See `AGENCY_AUDIT.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`, `TESTING.md`, `CONTACT_SETUP.md` and `SECURITY_STATUS.md` for implementation and setup details.
